# nexjts-supabase-todo-app

This project is a comprehensive demonstration of integrating Next.js with Supabase, Clerk, and Material UI to create a robust TODO application. It showcases CRUD operations, authentication, and a modern UI design.



## Overview

In this tutorial we will build a CRUD application by combining three major technologies. We will use Clerk for Auth, Supabase for database and Nextjs as a framework.
You will also learn in this guide:
 - How to create Route Handler with Nextjs 14 App Router?
 - How to set up Auth system with Clerk?
 - How to establish Supabase connection with JWT token?
